Shiprweck, parents mauled by a jaguar. Luckily, a troop of gorillas took him in, but the Big Daddy gorilla never took a liking to him. That is, until the end when it's too late. Why is it too late? Watch and find out." },

Trickster uncle, dying father, usurpation. Luckily, an unlikely meerkat-warthog pair take him in and teach him The Ways of the Bum Life. Be prepared for ghostly hallucinations, wild baboons, creepy crawlies." },

Belle shows everyone how great she is when she turns a beast (not Gaston) into a man. Love ensues, but then the villagers fall trap to severe group-think mentality led by the main tool himself." },

Alas, he is dubbed 'Wart' early on, and it was all downhill from there for a while. On a hunting trip he falls in on Merlin, literally. Merlin is a possibly-mentally-unstable-and-ethically-dubious Wizard that turns Arthur into a literate, at-one-point harassed squirrel. Watch to find out what the heck that means." },

Rumor has it that in the bonus scenes she whips out a wand and turns Gaston into a toad, but in order to watch those scenes you need to recite a certain incantation." }
